Pac-Man is a classic arcade game where a yellow creature navigates a maze. The goal is to consume pellets while avoiding four ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. Players control Pac-Man's movement, using power pellets for defense. A timeless classic, Pac-Man remains universally beloved and iconic.
